XGBoost generally exhibits better predictive performance than other machine learning in classification.
Although it's based on GBM, in the spotlight for solving problems such as slow performance time and lack of overfitting regulations, which are disadvantages of GBM.

​

The strongest strength of LightGBM is only taking less time than XGBoost is.
Furthermore the predictive performance of XGBoost and LightGBM is not much different.
The only drawback is that overfitting is easy to occur when it applied to small datasets.
