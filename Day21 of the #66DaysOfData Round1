ㆍI studied one of optimization methods called 'Hill climbing'. The crucial point of this method is that it does not guarantee that you find the absolute best solution.  
Moreover, there is an problem with the hill climbing that we can easily get stucked in a good but not optimal solution(Local optima).  
So, the simple hill climbing solution where we only go upwards is often called to be a greedy method which greedily optimizes the short term gain and  
refuses to incur some temporary loss even if it would lead to better long-term gain.

ㆍanother key terminology: Simulated annealing Instead of only allowing changes that improve the solution (go uphill),  
some changes that make it worse (go downhill) are also allowed with some probability.  Concept word  'Temperature' is important point in Simulated annealing.  
Simulated annealing is quite similar to Greedy search in that the optimization process is moving towards better solution.  
However, Simulated annealing accepts both better solutions and worse solutions.

ㆍIf we change the temperature higher in Simulated annealing, the algorithm takes all new solutions.  
On the other hand, low temperature as close as 0 only accepts new solutions when they are better than the current one.
