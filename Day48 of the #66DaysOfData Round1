ㆍ I thought I was going to die for three days. I got food poisoning for the first time in my life...  
I only knew that food poisoning was similar to enteritis, but it was literally like..hell.  
But now I'm much better, so I can start studying again. It's a shame that I fell for a short time with 66 days left,  
but I think it's a good thing that gave me a warning when I was running with careless my health.
