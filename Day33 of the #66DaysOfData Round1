ㆍ Following yesterday, I did a detailed data survey of NLP. There are 4 major steps in Data preprocessing and 3 steps in Creating a word set.  
ㆍ Procedure of Creating a word set  
Indexing the words -> Figure out words frequency -> Word Representation in Text Data  
ㆍThere are several methods for word representation in text data such as 'One-Hot Vector', 'N-gram', 'Bag of Words', 'Word2Vec', 'LSA', 'Glove'
