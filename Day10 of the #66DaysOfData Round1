I decided to post the algorithm problems that I solve every day as well from Baekjoon Online Judge (acmicpc.net). Its a Korean-style 'Leetcode'


ㆍI solved 3 algorithm problems from Basic Mathmatics. I don't know why the answer rate of the questions that I find difficult is so high.  
But the funny thing is that the questions I thought was easy has low answer rate.  
ㆍ Reviewed the Random Forest that I studied last week.  
ㆍ I attempted to visualize the data of 'Santander Product Recommendation' but Its not easy as much I expected.  
I want to see how much the each product changes depending on the date.


ㆍDataset I used  
Human Activity Recognition  
Santander Product Recommendation
