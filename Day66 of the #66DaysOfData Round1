ㆍ Today is the last day of the 66DAYSOFDATA challenge.  
At first, I posted what I studied every day as I intended, but later, it seems to have gradually changed to a diary format.  
Still, I am proud of myself for running for 66 days except when I have food poisoning.  
I was able to learn a lot from this challenge and I am very satisfied to make good habits.  
I will take a day off tomorrow ready for new achievement and start a new challenge from the next day.  
ㆍStudied MIN, MAX, COUNT, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY methods of SQL and solved 5 related algorithm questions from 'Programmers' as yesterday
