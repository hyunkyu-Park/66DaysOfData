„Üç Tomorrow, there is an interview where I can get a good education. Out of the 4,200 applicants, 45 were left through document screening, the first, and second tests and passed.  
Finally, 15 people who pass the interview will be selected to provide quality programming education for six months.  
To this end, I prepared interviews related to interviews and technical interviews and organized what I have been studying.
I hope I don't get nervous and have an interview with no regrets tomorrow.
