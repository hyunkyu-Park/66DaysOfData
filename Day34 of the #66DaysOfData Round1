ㆍI was confused relationship between one-hot Vector and Word Embedding.  
Because some people say 'Vectorizing is the word embedding' and others say 'Word embedding is the techniques for compressing words'.  
and now I know that It is a method to overcome the limitations of simple vectorization.   
ㆍAfter understanding the concept, I made a powerpoint to explain it to AIQ members.
