ㆍ I looked up news and videos about 'weverse' and 'Universe' this morning.  
I have come up with my own answers to the emergence of new platforms, the differences between each platform, and the direction of expansion of the business structure.  
At the meeting with the professor, I suggested 4 solutions, and I heard that three of them are already being projected by other startups.  
To be honest, I felt very despondent.  
However, professor told me that your proposals came out in only two days, and It means I have potential insight If it overlaps with a project already in progress.  
I was so grateful. I felt so lucky to be a member of his team.

ㆍ Reviewed the LightGBM that I studied last week.
