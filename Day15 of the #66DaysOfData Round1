I had a fender-bender today. I was totally exhausted because it was my first car accident.  
I literally considered whether to do study or not. However, 66 Days of Data challenge encouraged me to study.  
I do appreciate to #KenJee.

ㆍ Made 2 base line codes with XGBoost and LightGBM of the Santander Customer Satisfaction from the Kaggle  
ㆍ I learned 2 important things while making base line codes.  
  ㆍ If the number of columns is high, there is a possibility of overfitting.  
  ㆍ Using test datasets as evaluation datasets of XGBoost can cause of increasing the chance of overfitting.
