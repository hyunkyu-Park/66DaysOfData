Today, there were two big things: Samsung mentoring and natural language processing announcement.  
ㆍI met the two Samsung experts(They were called 'expert Ma', 'expert Cha'). One is a programmer and the other is data analyst.  
They gave insperation and shared their life lessons to the participated mentees. I feel glad having such a meaningful time with good people.  
ㆍAs a matter of fact, I was not worried about my presentation that much. However, It was harder that I thought it would be.  
I usually keep observing people's facial expressions and change the style of presentation continuously.  
However, doing a presentation on zoom was not as simple as general presentation. I should practice presentation assuming that I can't get feedback.
