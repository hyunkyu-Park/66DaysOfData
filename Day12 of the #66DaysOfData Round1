ㆍ Unfortunately, I failed to solve the algorithm question that I couldn't solve yesterday again...  
So I decide not to solve that question right now. I jumped to the next question!  
As a result, I finished two more questions and tried one question. They are last 3 questions of Basic Mathematics 1.  
That means, I am ready to start Basic Mathematics 2!!! WoW~  

ㆍ Reviewed the XGBoost(eXtra Gradient Boost) that I studied last week.  
ㆍ Looked over about the 'Dimension Reduction'. There are several ways to simplify dimensions such as PCA, LDA, SVD, NMF  
ㆍLooked over about the 'Clustering'. From the basic clustering method named 'K-means Algorithm' to the 'Mean Shift', 'GMM', 'DBSCAN', they are all fascinating.
