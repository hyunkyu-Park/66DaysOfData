ㆍHad a meeting to prepare for the AI storytelling class next week.  
They will be online and offline classes alternately, so I spent a lot of time discussing ways to fit each other.
ㆍ Studied 'The nearest neighbor method' at Building AI - 'How the nearest neighbor method is used for both regression and classification tasks'.
