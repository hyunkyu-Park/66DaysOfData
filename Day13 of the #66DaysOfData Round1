Fortunately, I got an interview request from the 'AIQ' and interviewed for almost an hour and a half last night.  
Although it was an interview to join the team, it was a fun and informative place of knowledge, contrary to worries.  
We talked about platforms of several entertainment companies, such as 'Big Hit's Weverse', 'Naver's Vlive', and 'NC SOFT's Universe',  
and their own unique business items for co-creating platform between fandom and artists.

ㆍ Anyway, I joined the club and had a first meeting. One of the members brought up the topic of hills climbing, one of the hyperparameter optimization methods.  
Two other members explained fundamentals of probability.

ㆍ After the theoretical part, we also talked about ai techniques used in start-up companies.  
It was super interesting and inspired me. I began to think every moment about how can we use Ai in reality.  
I have a meeting with the professor of the group tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it badly.
