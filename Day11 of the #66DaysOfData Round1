Day11 of the #66DaysOfData Round1.

ㆍ Following yesterday, I tried to solve 3 algorithm questions from basic mathematics.  
Solved 2 problems, but failed to solve last one. Its so annoying. If an error occurs and I correct it and resubmit, another error will occur.  
I am gonna try again tomorrow. Give me luck!  

ㆍ Reviewed the GBM(Gradient Boost Machine) that I studied last week.
