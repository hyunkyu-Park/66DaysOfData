ㆍSolved 2 algorithm questions about Goldbach's conjecture and Bertrand's postulate.  
Those are so challenging and I could think about the time complexity once again.  
ㆍEven though I didn't understand everything, I read the R&D article about Lightweight Deep Learning.  
I am going to summarize this article as soon as possible.
