„ÜçI think my day started with preparing for the interview and ended with the interview.  
I thought I was doing well when I was conducting the interview, but when I finished it, I keep thinking about what I was said about.  
I don't know when the results of the interview will come out, but I'll have to recall what I learned from the interview I saw today.  
1. Don't drink too much water during the interview.  
2. Think about a disagreement with my boss.  
3. Considering about how to act when a project fails.
