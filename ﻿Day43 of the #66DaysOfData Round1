Today was the last day I was dispatched to the Marvrus and worked as a research staff.  
It was a short time, but it was a memorable time, and I learned lots of things that I couldn't express enough.  
I learned many things such as the importance of team members, communication between company and team, and felt my lack of skills.  
I could see and experience things I didn't feel when I was studying alone, so I could get a lot of enlightenment. Moreover, It will help my growth, not just a passing memory.
