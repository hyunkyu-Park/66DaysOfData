★ Stacking Ensemble based on CV set
★ CV set-based stacking model uses the predicted result datasets based on cross-validation when creating datasets for the final meta-model to improve overfitting.
​
Step 1 - For each model, you generate data for training/testing for the meta-model based on the resulting values from which the original training/test data is predicted.
​
Step 2 - Combine all the training data generated by each individual models in the form of stacking and it's going to be a final training datasets for the meta-model.
Likewise, Combine all the test data generated by each individual models in the form of stacking and it's going to be a final test datasets for the meta-model.
The meta-model is learned based on the final generated training datasets and the label data of the original training data.
Finally, it predicts the final generated test datasets and evaluates it based on label data from the original test data.
