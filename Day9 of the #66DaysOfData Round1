★ Reviewed the Ensemble Learning that I studied last week.
★ Made Voting Classifier out of Logistic Regression and KNN.
★ EDA with the 'Santander Product Recommendation' which I started yesterday.
I read datasets, drew basic statistics. Furthermore, I also tried visualizing a single variable with bar graph.
But, its not easy to predict 7 products. I should search datasets more delicately.
