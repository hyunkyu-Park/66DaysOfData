Day2 of the #66DaysOfData Round1.

Yesterday, I experienced the simplest classification algorithm called Decision Tree.
Likewise Decision Tree, Ensemble Learning is one of the famous algorithm of classification and it shows the outstanding performance in structured data classification. Moreover, It is a technique to derive more accurate final predictions by generating multiple classifiers and combining their predictions. As far as I see the Ensemble is sort of collective intelligence, and it leads the Ensemble to diverse utilization.

★ Ensemble Learning - Voting, Bagging, Boosting
★ Voting - Hard Voting, Soft Voting
★ Bagging(Boostrap Aggregating) - Random Forest
★ GridSearchCV
★ Boosting - AdaBoost(Adaptive boosting)
★ Boosting - GBM(Gradient Boosting Machine) - GradientBoost
​
★Datasets I used
