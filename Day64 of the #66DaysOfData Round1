ㆍThe interview results came out right away. Unfortunately, I faced the result of being eliminated,  
but I would like to think it was a good opportunity to fill in the parts that would have been difficult to study if I studied alone.  
ㆍI had my first class at an elementary school in Jincheon, Chungbuk.

From next week, we are going to have many classes in earnest. I should think about what kind of study or project I should do in my spare time except for class preparation.
