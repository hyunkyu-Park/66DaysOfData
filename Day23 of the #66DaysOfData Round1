ㆍ I re-opened my jupyter notebook for 'Santander product recommendation competition' of Kaggle.  
I just finished data preprocessing last time, so I tried to figure out feature engineering.  
ㆍ Created the columns for machine learning model  training. I am going to use 'customer variables', 'variables based on dates', and 'lag-1' variable in baseline codes.  
ㆍReplace missing values with -99 when using derived variables.  
ㆍ'lag-1' variable is a variable that will be used as the current customer's data whether they held the product a month ago.  
Later, I will make several variables such as 'lag-2', 'lag-3' to see if these are effective.
