ㆍ I read the Linear Regression part of chapter 3 - Machine Learning from Building AI. The chapter introduces funny phrases from twitter.  
When fundraising: it's AI  
When recruiting: it's machine learning  
When implementing: it's linear regression  
In fact, I think this phrases become so popular because there is an element of truth in it.😁  
ㆍ They also explains the types of machine learning. Supervised learning, Un-supervised learning, and Reinforcement learning.  
The funny thing is that the way introduces these concepts are quite similar everywhere.  
If I may exaggerate, I have seen the examples of guessing apartment price and classifying dogs and cats over 3 times. lol
