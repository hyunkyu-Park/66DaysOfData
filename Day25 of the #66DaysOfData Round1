ㆍ I heard that brute-force search algorithm questions are interesting.  
I can understand a little bit what it means, however, It's so awkward solving algorithm with barely thinking time complexity.  

ㆍ Also, I studied 'Gradient descent' and 'Stochastic gradient descent'.  
I know it is very critical concept in machine learning and important in Neural networks which are the basis of Deep learning as well.  
Hence, I implemented both of them myself. Implementing it myself really helped me understand the concept of Gradient descent.  

ㆍAs I implement myself, I also realize that the disadvantage of gradient descent.  
The disadvantage of it is that it takes a very long time to perform because it repeatedly updates the value for minimizing the cost function for all learning data.  
To improve this issue, Stochastic gradient descent does not calculate the value at which is updated with full input data,  
but rather uses only some data to calculate the value at which w is updated, ensuring a faster rate than gradient descent.
