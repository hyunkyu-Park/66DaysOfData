ㆍI studied other basic algorithms, Calculating interval sums and Permutation-Combination, that useful in coding test.  
Also, solved several SQL questions, but, unfortunately, I couldn't study new concept of SQL such as 'logical operators', 'LIKE', and 'IN' etc.😂  
ㆍIn Kaggle challenge, I chose 'XGBoost' as a model for learning in base codes. In addition, I tried to make cross-validation, however, evaluation way is so unfamiliar.  
Hence, I barely understand even though I spent more than 2 hours.
